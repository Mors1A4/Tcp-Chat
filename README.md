# Tcp-Chat
This is a server and a client built in C# in visual studio for a chat application that runs in the windows console.

Here i have included the visual studio project files in the folders, furthermore as this is built as a stand alone executable i have also attached the final build executables for each.

Here are some screen shots for the client:
