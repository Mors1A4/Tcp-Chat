# Tcp-Chat
Tcp-Chat is a console-based chat application developed in C# using Visual Studio. It consists of a server and client, enabling network-based communication. Key features include:

Server-Client Architecture: The server handles multiple client connections, allowing real-time chat functionality.
Console Interface: Both server and client run in the Windows console, providing a text-based user interface.
C# Implementation: Utilizes C# networking libraries for socket communication.
This project demonstrates basic networking principles through a practical chat application.
